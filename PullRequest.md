# What is a Pull Request?
 The pull request is a way of asking for permission to add my aditional/fixed work
 to the overall project.
 - A Pull Request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another
## Pull Request Anti-patterns
 - PR are too big to contain many changes
 - PR are only created when a feature is done
 - PR are approved without code review and comment
 - Comments should be very helpful
